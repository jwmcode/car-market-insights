        <h2>Your valuation</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">Your vehicle is worth approximately <b>Â£{{ pred1 }}</b></p>
    <p>How do we do it? We'll try to keep it simple. We collect 1000+ AutoTrader listings
        every day for the visualisations on our home page, and based on the selection of vehicle attributes you provide us,
        we fit this data to our k-nearest neighbours regression model. We then pass the information you have provided
        to the model, and it returns a predicted vehicle value. Because our AutoTrader data is renewed every
        day, your valuation will be up-to-date.
     </p>

    <p> To evaluate the performance of the model, we use the r-squared score (R2). R2, in this case,
        indicates how much variation of vehicle price is explained by the independent variables: mileage, model year
        etc. In other words, it measures how well the model fits the data. If the model achieved an R2 score
        of 80%, that means that 80% of the data fits the model. <b> In this case, given the selection of vehicle features
        you have chosen, the model has achieved an R2 score of {{ r2_1 * 100 }}%. Whilst this gauges how well the model performs on this data, it does not reflect how accurate your individual
            valuation may be.
        </b> However, below are some plots that visualise the performance of our model.</p>



    <script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js"></script>

    <div id="plot1"></div>
    <script>
    Plotly.newPlot("plot1", {{ fig1 | safe }})
    </script>


    <p>To evaluate the performance of a model and produce an R2 value, the data must be split into test and train
    sets. The model is fit from the training data, and based on the results of this, the predictions are made on the
    test data. The R2 value is then calculated from the results of this. The graph above shows the model's predicted
        vehicle prices against the true prices, and the difference in
        outcome of the test and train datasets. The dotted line of best fit signifies the optimal fit, where the model's
        predicted price is exactly the true value. This graph also indicates model bias, and it clearly more accurately
        predicts the values of cars with a low
        actual price, and this is due to the data we use; the majority of adverts from AutoTrader are for vehicles
    in this price range. So if the information of a car you have provided is associated with a high value, this model
    will not predict accurately.</p>



    <div id="plot2"></div>
    <script>
    Plotly.newPlot("plot2", {{ fig2 | safe }})
    </script>

    <p>This second plot shows the residual errors between the predicted and true values in the test and train
        datasets, as well as their distribution. You will notice that the residuals get larger as the predictions
        increase, this is called heteroscedasticity, and is a result of the slightly compromised data we use, as
        discussed previously. Aside from these outliers (expensive vehicles), the distribution of residual errors is
        healthy, and follows a normal distribution.
